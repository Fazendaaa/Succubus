package succubus

// LexerConfig goes trough the "logic" behind a Succubus' configuration file.
// It's important tho to point out that this or any other function presented
// in this package checks whether or not the given command is "plausible" just
// if all the key have a string as a value; if a image tag points to a
// non-existing image or if a command is wrongfull typed or even not exists,
// this function doesn't perform this kind of pre-processing due to the runtime
// nature of those tasks.
// It returns the processed config file
func LexerConfig(parsed Config) (succ Config, err error) {
	return succ, nil
}
