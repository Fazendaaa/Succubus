# Company

This doc shows some of the benefits of using Succubus as a Project tool in your company; as a everyday development tool.

Some of the benefits are related to:

- No need to install any compiler/interpreter in your team machines
- You can remove the `Dockerfile` from the repo -- avoiding someone messing with it just to go through some CI/CD stage --
- Avoids some compiler updates breaking the operational system and vice-versa
- Your team can use a plethora of Operational Systems (OSes) in their more different versions and architectures -- it won't break the Project development cycle
- You can upgrade your whole Project framework/compiler version by just changing one line
- etc.

Besides that, you won't need to know Go or even anything related to Docker or even the Projects for that matter to adjust Succubus to meet your needs. The whole idea is to allow anyone to benefit from this without ever needing to touch a single line of code.

## Scenarios

- You have a current running Project in which many developers are having issues in CI/CD because they missed some dependency just by adding it to their machines
- You cannot easily test many different package/languages versions without having headaches when everything fails

## Due diligence

> This code is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and always will be!

The whole idea behind this project is to allow many people to better understand the container technology and better fit it to their needs, in every single imaginable project that there's out there. That's why a solid implementation is needed and that's also one of the reasons that this project uses

## Zero Trust

- You can implement your own version
- You can change this version
- You can do anything you like to it -- as long you follow the [LICENSE](../LICENSE)

## Build your own

You can always build the whole Project concept presented here in another language like Python, Java, Rust and etc.; but you can also adapt this whole to fit your own needs and to do so you just need to:
