# What is Succubus?

Succubus could mean basically three things:

- A Project standard
- A code base
- A implementation of that standard

And you can learn more about how you can use each one of those just by taking a look at each one as follows:

- [What is Succubus?](#what-is-succubus)
  - [Standard](#standard)
  - [Code](#code)
  - [Pattern](#pattern)

## Standard

Succubus is the standard to implement Project following the basic rules:

1. A Project is formed by Objectives
2. Those Objectives are formed by Tasks
3. And each Tasks is a sequence of Commands

```shell
          Project
|--------------------------|
|        Objectives        |
| |----------------------| |
| |        Tasks         | |
| | |------------------| | |
| | |     Commands     | | |
| | |------------------| | |
| |----------------------| |
|--------------------------|
```

## Code

Succubus is the Go code presented in this repository in which implements the Succubus standard pointed out previously.

If you want to implement the Succubus's [standard](#standard) or even its [pattern](#pattern) in another language, please fell free to do so and share it so that can be listed here as a option so other people can take a look and even help with the effort.

## Pattern

Succubus is also the pattern following the Succubus standard and the Succubus code presented here in this repository. What this also means that you can implement another pattern using the standard and the code that deviates from the one presented here, and you can call it anything that you like. You are free to do so and can enjoy the benefits from it later on.

As said in the [code](#code) definition, if you want to share a pattern that you implemented, please fell free so can be listed here as an option to others to follow.

You can read more about it and how to it in [here](company.md).
